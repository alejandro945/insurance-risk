# Insurance Risk Analysis ðŸ“£

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the risk of insurance claims using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset consists of 26 columns and 205 rows, providing various features related to insurance risk. By analyzing this data, we seek to build predictive models that can help insurers assess the risk of claims.

##Â Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

columns:
- symboling
- normalized-losses
- make
- fuel-type
- aspiration
- num-of-doors
- body-style
- drive-wheels
- engine-location
- wheel-base
- length
- width
- height
- curb-weight
- engine-type
- num-of-cylinders
- engine-size
- fuel-system
- bore
- stroke
- compression-ratio
- horsepower
- peak-rpm
- city-mpg
- highway-mpg
- price

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build predictive models that can help in assessing the risk of insurance claims based on the given dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:alejandro945/insurance-risk.git
```
